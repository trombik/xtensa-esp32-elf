Rust for Xtensa-based ESP32, ESP32-SXX and ESP8266 using Espressif's llvm
fork (RiscV chips like ESP32-CXX are already supported in stock Rust).

Provides Rust STD support (networking, threads, and filesystem) for all chips
in the ESP32 family (Xtensa and RiscV), by optionally linking with the ESP-IDF
framework.

The port installs everything for building rust applications for ESP chips.
